    <p> About:This project aims to develop an AI-based skin disease detection system using deep learning algorithms and computer vision techniques. The proposed system will be capable of analyzing images of skin lesions and identifying various types of dermatological conditions, including but not limited to melanoma, psoriasis, eczema, and acne. The development process involves several key stages. Firstly, a diverse dataset of high-resolution skin lesion images will be collected from reliable sources and annotated by dermatologists to ensure accuracy. Next, state-of-the-art deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), will be trained on the dataset to learn discriminative features and patterns associated with different skin diseases. The trained model will then be integrated into a user-friendly interface, allowing healthcare professionals and individuals to upload skin images for analysis. The system will provide real-time predictions along with confidence scores, aiding dermatologists in making informed decisions about diagnosis and treatment options.
